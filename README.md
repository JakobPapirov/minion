# Minion
Website for my minion!

The landing-page is a fun way to keep track of how many seconds the minion is and it also lets me keep track of any special occasions that could potentially be celebrated. The possibilities are endless!

Over at the learning section of the website I'm now working on svg-games (my way of learning SVG) as well as some language related stuff, with the main focus being Russian.

# Learning
As my minion isn't three yet, the difficulty of the learning material is at that level. I'm trying to train her to use the mouse, logical thinking and more.

# Tech
The website is written in HTML. W3.CSS is used as well as jQuery (JS). Icons from icons8.
